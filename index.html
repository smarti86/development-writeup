        <h1> Development Handin Webpage</h1>
        <div class="about-section">
            <p>Hello! I'm Sandy and for the development assignemnt, I wanted to create a market place for t-shirts and 
                tees. There no one dedicated website for great t-shirts so I just had to make my own. As I user, I often get 
                overwhelmed by how many filters and sort options there are, or how hidden they are. This often stops me from using them. 
                With my website. Sandy's T-Shirts and Tees, I want to implement different filters and sorting and make them the focal point of the website
                while also maintaining a minimal design! <br> </p>
        </div>
       
        <h1>Part 1: Competitive Analysis</h1>
            <h3><br>Rubric: Completed Competitive Comparison table that includes 3 different websites</h3>

             <h3>Rubric: Includes link to each website being compared</h4>
                 <p>Zara - https://www.zara.com/us/en/search?searchTerm=tshirts&section=WOMAN</p>
                 <p>Redbubble - https://www.redbubble.com/shop/womens-t-shirts </p>
                 <p>Not On The High Street - https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/gifts/shop-by-recipient/for-her</p>

    
            <h3><br> Rubric: Competitive Comparison Chart includes criteria that appropriately differentiates between the three websites </h3>            
                <p>Zara - Zara is a fast fashion company that sells t-shirts and tees amongst other clothing. There’s a running joke on TikTok, Instagram, and X that the Zara website is horribly designed and unintuitive. Zara offers two filters: size and color. Within those filters, there is the option to reset them. Zara has no sorting features; thus did not check off factors 2, 6, and 7. When looking simply at the Bookmarked feature (similar to favoriting), there are no additional filters or sorts; there is only the option to add to cart.</p>
                <p>Redbubble - Redbubble is a global online marketplace for print-on-demand t-shirts based on user-submitted artwork. Redbubble offers a favorite feature, which allows you to save t-shirt designs that you like. Within the favoriting feature list, there are no additional filters or sorts; there is only the option to ‘Add all to cart.’ In the general Redbubble ‘Women's T-Shirts & Tops’ section, there is a side navigation bar that allows the user to filter by color and size.  Additional filter categories include clothing category, gender, fit, style, neckline, sleeve length, and price. While there is a price filter, there is no price sorting. The only sorting available is most relevant, newest, trending, and best selling.</p>
                <p>Not On The High Street - Not On The High Street is a marketplace that champions over 5,000 small businesses with a focus on gifting items. Their filtering options do not include size or color for women’s t-shirts. However, they do have filtering for delivery, price, discount, categories, personalization, special features, and delivery zone. They also have price sorting, as well as sorting by relevance and newest. I found it interesting that they include both a price sort and filter. When looking simply at the favorites list feature, there are no additional filters or sorts; there is only the option to add to cart. </p>

            <h3>Rubric: Summary paragraph outlining what was most/least successful</h3>
                <h4>Rubric: Includes justification</h4>
                <h4>Rubric: References design principles learned in class</h4>
                    <p>The comparative analysis was helpful because it helped me find the most fundamental filters and sorting available for my intended website of women's t-shirts and tees. For example, Zara had the most bare-bones filters, with only size and color. Thus, this signaled that these are amongst the main filters users use and convinced me to include this filter in my own development. Redbubble also included the size and  color, along with other filters that I considered irrelevant, such as: neckline and sleeve length. There is not much variation in the neckline and sleeve length for t-shirts and tees, so I considered these filters unnecessary and added extra functionality to the website that might contribute to the visual clutter and confuse the user. My most successful takeaway from Not On The High Street was its sorting features. They included price and relevance sorting, and also had a price filter. After asking family and friends, I determined that price sorting is more helpful than price sorting, but appreciated that Not On The High Street  included both. </p>

            <h3>Rubric: List of features that you will attempt to implement, ideally inspired from your competitive analysis </h3>
                <p>Inspired by Zara, I will focus on the two filtering features I determined to be most essential to the user experience when looking for women’s t-shirts and tees: size filter and color filter. Inspired by Not On The High Street’s sorting features, I will implement price sorting. Although not in my comparative analysis, all of the websites that I compared have cart features as their aggregate feature, so I will be implementing a cart feature as well. Lastly, I don’t like how filters and sorts are often hidden in a side navigation bar or button, so I will put them on my top navigation bar and make it one of the focuses for when I use my website.                 </p>

        <h1>Part 3: Functionality</h1>
         <h3>Implementation:</h3>
         <h3>Rubric: Include a few sentences about the intention of your app and how you are incorporating filter, sort, and aggregation using your theme.</h3>
            <p>My intention is to create a marketplace for t-shirts and tees. Motivated by my current need for summer tops, I included the two filters and one sort that I saw were most relevant: size, color, and price, respectively. This determination came from the competitive analysis websites I observed. The user will see the filters and sorting at the very top, input their information, and find their perfect match for a shirt or tee. For my aggregation, I used a cart since the goal is for a user to like a shirt or tee and then continue to add it to their cart and purchase it. </p>

         <h3>App functionality</h3>
         <h3>Rubric: At least 2 filtering categories that work as expected</h3>
            <p>Included: Size and color filtering</p>

        <h3>Rubric: At least 1 sorting category that works as expected</h3>
            <p>Included: Price sorting </p>

        <h3>Rubric: Includes a way to reset filters and sorts</h3>
            <p>On resetting for filter and sort: 
                Although not necessarily a factor I could compare in the competitive analysis, I also want to be intentional with my reset functionality. I noticed the pattern that regardless of whether it was sorting or filtering, there was no consistent resetting. For example, Zara has a ‘clear’ button for the filters to reset them while Redbubble does not. I determined that resetting matters most in the context of the data type that I present the information. 
                For example, the checkbox structure that I choose to represent the size and color filtering is for toggling a true/false state. Therefore, resetting is inherent in the data type because the state can just be set to ‘false’ by unchecking. Checkbox structures were common across the filtering and sorting of Zara, Redbubble, and Not On The High Street and they did not include reset functionality within their checkbox. Thus, I felt comfortable using checkboxes and not including a reset checkbox. 
                For my price sorting, I choose a drop down structure that contains string data. Thus, it makes sense to also contain a string value “reset” that clears the price sorting previously in place. 
                I spoke with TAs about this logic and was given green light
